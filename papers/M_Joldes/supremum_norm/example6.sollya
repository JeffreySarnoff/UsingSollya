/* Example 6 */

/* This example is meant to be used with the version of Sollya
   available by SVN, the 27th of October 2008. You can get it
   by applying the following command:

 svn checkout svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya -r {2008-10-27}

   You need to compile Sollya itself (see sollya/trunk/README)
   and to compile manually the files sturm.c and autodiff.c
   (instructions are give in the files themselves).

   The directory containing the present file must also contain
   the files infinityNorm.sollya, findZerosFamilyOfPoly.sollya
   and getTaylorPoly.sollya

   These files are just prototypes distributed as is. It may fail
   to compute a certified infinity norm in some cases.
